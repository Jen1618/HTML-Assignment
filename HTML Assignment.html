        One of my favorite things to do before the pandemic was to play on my college's rugby team and this is something 
        I am looking foward to doing again.

        Another one of my pastimes is to listen to music. 
        I have recently gotten into kpop but before that I was really into spanish trap and emo rock.

        My third hobby would be to go walking around my neighborhood with my dogs.
        With the pandemic it was tiring to be inside my house the whole time so I made it a habit to go on a walk as a way to destress.
